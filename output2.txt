There might have been twenty people there,
young and old, but they all played, and so did Scrooge; for

Nor was it that the figs
were moist and pulpy, or that the French plums blushed in
modest tartness from their highly-decorated boxes, or that
everything was good to eat and in its Christmas dress; but
the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful
promise of the day, that they tumbled up against each other
at the door, crashing their wicker baskets wildly, and left
their purchases upon the counter, and came running back to
fetch them, and committed hundreds of the like mistakes, in
the best humour possible; while the Grocer and his people
were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which
they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own,
worn outside for general inspection, and for Christmas daws
to peck at if they chose.

cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;\r\nbackward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow\r\nlovable.', u'And see here, sir, if by any\r\nchance he was to ask you in, don\u2019t go.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson\u2019s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk\r\nthat nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage\r\nand followed the butler into the laboratory building through the\r\nsurgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of\r\nthe stair.', u'From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: \u201cAnd\r\nyou don\u2019t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA likely place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d returned Mr. Enfield.', u'\u201cThese are all very strange circumstances,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \u201cbut I\r\nthink I begin to see daylight.', u'I saw him use it\r\nnot a week ago.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man\r\npresently resumed.', u'What does the\r\nman mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI daren\u2019t say, sir,\u201d was the answer; \u201cbut will you come along with me\r\nand see for yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson\u2019s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;\r\nbut he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared\r\nupon the butler\u2019s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was\r\nstill untasted when he set it down to follow.', u'\u201cIs\r\nthat right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,\u201d replied the servant.', u'it\u2019s Mr. Utterson,\u201d ran forward as if to\r\ntake him in her arms.', u'INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW\r\n\r\nIt chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.\r\nEnfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that\r\nwhen they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.', u'I don\u2019t know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr.\r\nHyde?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the lawyer, \u201cI once spoke with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something\r\nqueer about that gentleman\u2014something that gave a man a turn\u2014I don\u2019t\r\nknow rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your\r\nmarrow kind of cold and thin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI own I felt something of what you describe,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'The\r\nclerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a\r\ndocument without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson\r\nmight shape his future course.', u'Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the\r\nstick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and\r\nbattered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself\r\npresented many years before to Henry Jekyll.', u'No, sir;\r\nmaster\u2019s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we\r\nheard him cry out upon the name of God; and _who\u2019s_ in there instead of\r\nhim, and _why_ it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr.\r\nUtterson!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my\r\nman,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger.', u'THE LAST NIGHT\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when\r\nhe was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.', u'\u201cWhose description?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have common friends,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'\u201cAnd\r\nnow,\u201d continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, \u201creach me a\r\ncandle, and we\u2019ll get this through hands at once.\u201d And then he begged\r\nMr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.', u'And yet it\u2019s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed\r\ntogether about the court, that it\u2019s hard to say where one ends and\r\nanother begins.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then \u201cEnfield,\u201d\r\nsaid Mr. Utterson, \u201cthat\u2019s a good rule of yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I think it is,\u201d returned Enfield.', u'\u201cThank you,\r\nsir,\u201d he said at last, returning both; \u201cit\u2019s a very interesting\r\nautograph.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself.', u'The cheque was genuine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTut-tut!\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the\r\nby-street of shops.', u'At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up\r\nfrom his chair and welcomed him with both hands.', u'What has he done?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances.', u'\u201cI did not\r\nthink you would have lied.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \u201cthat is not fitting language.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with\r\nextraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into\r\nthe house.', u'\u201cI\u2019ve seen him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSeen him?\u201d repeated Mr. Utterson.', u'\u201cIndeed\r\nwe see very little of him on this side of the house;

STORY OF THE DOOR

Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was
never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;
backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow
lovable.
La minore:
The cheque was genuine.”

“Tut-tut!” said Mr. Utterson.

set([u'This hall, in which he was now left alone, was a pet fancy\r\nof his friend the doctor\u2019s; and Utterson himself was wont to speak of\r\nit as the pleasantest room in London.', u'And in the meantime, if you can sit and talk with me\r\nof other things, for God\u2019s sake, stay and do so; but if you cannot keep\r\nclear of this accursed topic, then in God\u2019s name, go, for I cannot bear\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,\r\ncomplaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of\r\nthis unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long\r\nanswer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious\r\nin drift.', u'much as if a\r\nman had stamped on it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy,\u201d continued Utterson, \u201cand the fractures, too, are rusty.\u201d The two\r\nmen looked at each other with a scare.', u'Within there was another enclosure,\r\nlikewise sealed, and marked upon the cover as \u201cnot to be opened till\r\nthe death or disappearance of Dr. Henry Jekyll.\u201d Utterson could not\r\ntrust his eyes.', u'\u201cAnd now,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, as soon as Poole had left them, \u201cyou have\r\nheard the news?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor shuddered.', u'In silence, too, they traversed the\r\nby-street; and it was not until they had come into a neighbouring\r\nthoroughfare, where even upon a Sunday there were still some stirrings\r\nof life, that Mr. Utterson at last turned and looked at his companion.', u'I give you my hand upon that; and I thank you again and again; and I\r\nwill just add one little word, Utterson, that I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll take in\r\ngood part: this is a private matter, and I beg of you to let it sleep.\u201d\r\n\r\nUtterson reflected a little, looking in the fire.', u'Utterson, sir, asking to see you,\u201d he called; and even as he did\r\nso, once more violently signed to the lawyer to give ear.', u'Much as I desire to spare your master\u2019s feelings, much\r\nas I am puzzled by this note which seems to prove him to be still\r\nalive, I shall consider it my duty to break in that door.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, Mr. Utterson, that\u2019s talking!\u201d cried the butler.', u'This drug is wanted bitter bad, sir,\r\nwhatever for.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHave you any of these papers?\u201d asked Mr. Utterson.', u'But I do\r\nsincerely take a great, a very great interest in that young man;

one lay\r\nbeside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy\r\nof a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great\r\nesteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.', u'\u201cYou may depend upon it, sir,\u201d he told Mr. Utterson: \u201cI have him in my\r\nhand.', u'\u201cOn your side,\u201d said Mr. Utterson \u201cwill you do me a favour?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWith pleasure,\u201d replied the other.', u'What does the\r\nman mean?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI daren\u2019t say, sir,\u201d was the answer; \u201cbut will you come along with me\r\nand see for yourself?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson\u2019s only answer was to rise and get his hat and greatcoat;\r\nbut he observed with wonder the greatness of the relief that appeared\r\nupon the butler\u2019s face, and perhaps with no less, that the wine was\r\nstill untasted when he set it down to follow.', u'\u201cGod grant I have no\r\ncause for it!\u201d And with that he brought the paper to his eyes and read\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\u201cMy dear Utterson,\u2014When this shall fall into your hands, I shall have\r\ndisappeared, under what circumstances I have not the penetration to\r\nforesee, but my instinct and all the circumstances of my nameless\r\nsituation tell me that the end is sure and must be early.', u'it\u2019s Mr. Utterson,\u201d ran forward as if to\r\ntake him in her arms.', u'INCIDENT AT THE WINDOW\r\n\r\nIt chanced on Sunday, when Mr. Utterson was on his usual walk with Mr.\r\nEnfield, that their way lay once again through the by-street; and that\r\nwhen they came in front of the door, both stopped to gaze on it.', u'I don\u2019t know, Mr. Utterson, if you ever met this Mr.\r\nHyde?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the lawyer, \u201cI once spoke with him.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThen you must know as well as the rest of us that there was something\r\nqueer about that gentleman\u2014something that gave a man a turn\u2014I don\u2019t\r\nknow rightly how to say it, sir, beyond this: that you felt in your\r\nmarrow kind of cold and thin.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI own I felt something of what you describe,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the\r\nstick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and\r\nbattered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself\r\npresented many years before to Henry Jekyll.', u'THE LAST NIGHT\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson was sitting by his fireside one evening after dinner, when\r\nhe was surprised to receive a visit from Poole.', u'\u201cThank you,\r\nsir,\u201d he said at last, returning both; \u201cit\u2019s a very interesting\r\nautograph.\u201d\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, during which Mr. Utterson struggled with himself.', u'You have not been mad enough to hide\r\nthis fellow?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUtterson, I swear to God,\u201d cried the doctor, \u201cI swear to God I will\r\nnever set eyes on him again.', u'The night after the funeral, at which he\r\nhad been sadly affected, Utterson locked the door of his business room,\r\nand sitting there by the light of a melancholy candle, drew out and set\r\nbefore him an envelope addressed by the hand and sealed with the seal\r\nof his dead friend.', u'The note was handed in.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cShall I keep this and sleep upon it?\u201d asked Utterson.', u'\u201cIndeed\r\nwe see very little of him on this side of the house; he mostly comes\r\nand goes by the laboratory.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, good-night, Poole.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cGood-night, Mr. Utterson.\u201d\r\n\r\nAnd the lawyer set out homeward with a very heavy heart.', u'\u201cGod forgive us, God forgive us,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'\u201cOr he may have fled,\u201d said Utterson, and he turned to examine the door\r\nin the by-street.', u'The cheque was genuine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTut-tut!\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'I will say but one\r\nthing, Utterson, and that (if you can bring your mind to credit it)\r\nwill be more than enough.', u'\u201cI am quite done with that person; and I beg that you will spare me any\r\nallusion to one whom I regard as dead.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTut, tut!\u201d said Mr. Utterson; and then after a considerable pause,\r\n\u201cCan\u2019t I do anything?\u201d he inquired.', u'The will was holograph, for\r\nMr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had\r\nrefused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided\r\nnot only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L.,\r\nL.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands\r\nof his \u201cfriend and benefactor Edward Hyde,\u201d but that in case of Dr.\r\nJekyll\u2019s \u201cdisappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding\r\nthree calendar months,\u201d the said Edward Hyde should step into the said\r\nHenry Jekyll\u2019s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or\r\nobligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the\r\ndoctor\u2019s household.', u'Mr. Utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, \u201cIf you will come\r\nwith me in my cab,\u201d he said, \u201cI think I can take you to his house.\u201d\r\n\r\nIt was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of the\r\nseason.', u'Make a\r\nclean breast of this in confidence; and I make no doubt I can get you\r\nout of it.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cMy good Utterson,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cthis is very good of you, this is\r\ndownright good of you, and I cannot find words to thank you in.', u'DR. JEKYLL WAS QUITE AT EASE\r\n\r\nA fortnight later, by excellent good fortune, the doctor gave one of\r\nhis pleasant dinners to some five or six old cronies, all intelligent,\r\nreputable men and all judges of good wine; and Mr. Utterson so\r\ncontrived that he remained behind after the others had departed.', u'\u201cWe have all orders to obey\r\nhim.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI do not think I ever met Mr. Hyde?\u201d asked Utterson.', u'He was dressed in clothes far too large\r\nfor him, clothes of the doctor\u2019s bigness; the cords of his face still\r\nmoved with a semblance of life, but life was quite gone; and by the\r\ncrushed phial in the hand and the strong smell of kernels that hung\r\nupon the air, Utterson knew that he was looking on the body of a\r\nself-destroyer.', u'No, sir;\r\nmaster\u2019s made away with; he was made away with eight days ago, when we\r\nheard him cry out upon the name of God; and _who\u2019s_ in there instead of\r\nhim, and _why_ it stays there, is a thing that cries to Heaven, Mr.\r\nUtterson!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a very strange tale, Poole; this is rather a wild tale my\r\nman,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, biting his finger.', u'I was thinking of my own character, which this\r\nhateful business has rather exposed.\u201d\r\n\r\nUtterson ruminated awhile; he was surprised at his friend\u2019s\r\nselfishness, and yet relieved by it.', u'Utterson,\u201d said the man, \u201cthere is something wrong.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTake a seat, and here is a glass of wine for you,\u201d said the lawyer.', u'\u201cI shake hands on that, Richard.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEARCH FOR MR. HYDE\r\n\r\nThat evening Mr. Utterson came home to his bachelor house in sombre\r\nspirits and sat down to dinner without relish.', u'Such unscientific balderdash,\u201d added the doctor, flushing suddenly\r\npurple, \u201cwould have estranged Damon and Pythias.\u201d\r\n\r\nThis little spirit of temper was somewhat of a relief to Mr. Utterson.', u'\r\nThe Project Gutenberg EBook of The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr.\r\nHyde, by Robert Louis Stevenson\r\n\r\nThis eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with\r\nalmost no restrictions whatsoever.You may copy it, give it away or\r\nre-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included\r\nwith this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nTitle: The Strange Case Of Dr. Jekyll And Mr. Hyde\r\n\r\nAuthor: Robert Louis Stevenson\r\n\r\nRelease Date: June 25, 2008 [EBook #43]\r\nLast Updated: December 6, 2018\r\n\r\nLanguage: English\r\n\r\nCharacter set encoding: UTF-8\r\n\r\n\r\n*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK\r\nTHE STRANGE CASE OF DR.

cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;\r\nbackward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow\r\nlovable.', u'It is\r\nnow ten; I must go home and read these documents in quiet; but I shall\r\nbe back before midnight, when we shall send for the police.\u201d\r\n\r\nThey went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and\r\nUtterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire in the\r\nhall, trudged back to his office to read the two narratives in which\r\nthis mystery was now to be explained.', u'\u201cSir,\u201d he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, \u201cWas that my master\u2019s\r\nvoice?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems much changed,\u201d replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look\r\nfor look.', u'\u201cIs\r\nthat right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,\u201d replied the servant.', u'The\r\nclerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a\r\ndocument without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson\r\nmight shape his future course.', u'\u201cI am painfully\r\nsituated, Utterson; my position is a very strange\u2014a very strange one.', u'I see little of him now.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed?\u201d said Utterson.', u'I could\r\nnot think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors\r\nso unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this\r\ndestiny, and that is to respect my silence.\u201d Utterson was amazed; the\r\ndark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to\r\nhis old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with\r\nevery promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment,\r\nfriendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were\r\nwrecked.', u'It is one thing to mortify curiosity, another to conquer it; and it may\r\nbe doubted if, from that day forth, Utterson desired the society of his\r\nsurviving friend with the same eagerness.', u'\u201cI did not\r\nthink you would have lied.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \u201cthat is not fitting language.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with\r\nextraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into\r\nthe house.', u'Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an\r\nimpression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a\r\ndispleasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of\r\nmurderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,\r\nwhispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against\r\nhim, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown\r\ndisgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him.', u'Utterson sighed.', u'You had a fine\r\nescape.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI have had what is far more to the purpose,\u201d returned the doctor\r\nsolemnly: \u201cI have had a lesson\u2014O God, Utterson, what a lesson I have\r\nhad!\u201d And he covered his face for a moment with his hands.', u'\u201cI will see, Mr. Utterson,\u201d said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he\r\nspoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags,\r\nwarmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,\r\nand furnished with costly cabinets of oak.', u'From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of\r\nthe murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on,\r\nMr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to\r\ngrow more at quiet with himself.', u'The middle one of the three windows was half-way open; and\r\nsitting close beside it, taking the air with an infinite sadness of\r\nmien, like some disconsolate prisoner, Utterson saw Dr. Jekyll.', u'\u201cAnd now comes the second question,\u201d resumed Utterson: \u201cWho is going to\r\ndo it?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, you and me, sir,\u201d was the undaunted reply.', u'And it\u2019s not want of memory; for I declare\r\nI can see him this moment.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson again walked some way in silence and obviously under a\r\nweight of consideration.', u'\u201cYes, I know,\u201d said Utterson; \u201cI know it must seem strange.', u'We shall never\r\nsee more of Mr. Hyde.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope not,\u201d said Utterson.', u'Where Utterson was liked, he was liked well.', u'The first was a will, drawn in\r\nthe same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months\r\nbefore, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift\r\nin case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the\r\nlawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John\r\nUtterson.', u'It was a\r\nman of the name of Hyde.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHm,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative\r\nat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar\r\ncatholicity of good-nature.', u'It was partly your own fault that\r\nI found it out, even when I did.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSo you found it out, did you?\u201d said Utterson.', u'\u201cThe man, of course, was mad.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI should like to hear your views on that,\u201d replied Utterson.', u'\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in\r\nhis voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across\r\nthe yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the\r\nbeetles were leaping on the floor.', u'It seemed to have swept the streets\r\nunusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had\r\nnever seen that part of London so deserted.', u'A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the\r\nwind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so\r\nthat as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a\r\nmarvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be\r\ndark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich,\r\nlurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here,\r\nfor a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of\r\ndaylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths.', u'\u201cPRIVATE: for the hands of G.

Utterson ALONE,\r\nand in case of his predecease _to be destroyed unread_,\u201d so it was\r\nemphatically superscribed; and the lawyer dreaded to behold the\r\ncontents.', u'Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.', u'A purse and gold\r\nwatch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a\r\nsealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the\r\npost, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.', u'On the 8th of January Utterson had dined at the doctor\u2019s with a small\r\nparty; Lanyon had been there; and the face of the host had looked from\r\none to the other as in the old days when the trio were inseparable\r\nfriends.', u'\u201cNow I shall know you\r\nagain,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'I was never more disappointed in any man than Lanyon.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou know I never approved of it,\u201d pursued Utterson, ruthlessly\r\ndisregarding the fresh topic.', u'And see here, sir, if by any\r\nchance he was to ask you in, don\u2019t go.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson\u2019s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk\r\nthat nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage\r\nand followed the butler into the laboratory building through the\r\nsurgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of\r\nthe stair.', u'From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: \u201cAnd\r\nyou don\u2019t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA likely place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d returned Mr. Enfield.', u'Utterson became so\r\nused to the unvarying character of these reports, that he fell off\r\nlittle by little in the frequency of his visits.', u'It was unlikely that the doctor should fear death; and yet\r\nthat was what Utterson was tempted to suspect.', u'\u201cI don\u2019t ask that,\u201d pleaded Jekyll, laying his hand upon the other\u2019s\r\narm; \u201cI only ask for justice; I only ask you to help him for my sake,\r\nwhen I am no longer here.\u201d\r\n\r\nUtterson heaved an irrepressible sigh.', u'At the sight of\r\nMr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the\r\ncook, crying out \u201cBless God!', u'\u201cYes,\u201d he thought; \u201che\r\nis a doctor, he must know his own state and that his days are counted;\r\nand the knowledge is more than he can bear.\u201d And yet when Utterson\r\nremarked on his ill looks, it was with an air of great firmness that\r\nLanyon declared himself a doomed man.', u'\u201cSome day, Utterson, after\r\nI am dead, you may perhaps come to learn the right and wrong of this.', u'And yet it\u2019s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed\r\ntogether about the court, that it\u2019s hard to say where one ends and\r\nanother begins.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then \u201cEnfield,\u201d\r\nsaid Mr. Utterson, \u201cthat\u2019s a good rule of yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I think it is,\u201d returned Enfield.', u'\u201cMy poor Utterson,\u201d said he, \u201cyou\r\nare unfortunate in such a client.', u'From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the\r\nby-street of shops.', u'At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up\r\nfrom his chair and welcomed him with both hands.', u'But hark again, a little closer\u2014put your heart in your ears, Mr.\r\nUtterson, and tell me, is that the doctor\u2019s foot?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they\r\nwent so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread\r\nof Henry Jekyll.', u'\u201cI\u2019ve seen him!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cSeen him?\u201d repeated Mr. Utterson.', u'One house, however, second from the corner, was still\r\noccupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of\r\nwealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for\r\nthe fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked.', u'On the desk, among the neat\r\narray of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the\r\ndoctor\u2019s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson.', u'\u201cBut I happen to have\r\nnoticed his address; he lives in some square or other.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you never asked about the\u2014place with the door?\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'To this\r\nrule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite\r\nside of the fire\u2014a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with\r\nsomething of a stylish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and\r\nkindness\u2014you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson\r\na sincere and warm affection.', u'Utterson of Gaunt Street\u2014you must have heard of my\r\nname; and meeting you so conveniently, I thought you might admit me.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou will not find Dr. Jekyll; he is from home,\u201d replied Mr. Hyde,\r\nblowing in the key.', u'\u201cI give you fair warning, our\r\nsuspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,\u201d he resumed; \u201cif\r\nnot by fair means, then by foul\u2014if not of your consent, then by brute\r\nforce!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUtterson,\u201d said the voice, \u201cfor God\u2019s sake, have mercy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s not Jekyll\u2019s voice\u2014it\u2019s Hyde\u2019s!\u201d cried Utterson.', u'That won\u2019t hold water;

this is really a great pleasure; I would ask\r\nyou and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, then,\u201d said the lawyer, good-naturedly, \u201cthe best thing we can do\r\nis to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is just what I was about to venture to propose,\u201d returned the\r\ndoctor with a smile.', u'Mr. Utterson, sir, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my good man,\u201d said the lawyer, \u201cbe explicit.', u'I saw him use it\r\nnot a week ago.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man\r\npresently resumed.', u'\u201cI understand.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the\r\nnote into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward.', u'I should like to leave it in\r\nyour hands, Utterson; you would judge wisely, I am sure; I have so\r\ngreat a trust in you.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYou fear, I suppose, that it might lead to his detection?\u201d asked the\r\nlawyer.', u'Mr. Utterson\r\nhad been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light\r\nfootstep drawing near.', u'Anything private, Mr. Utterson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly an invitation to dinner.', u'A closet was filled with\r\nwine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung\r\nupon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who\r\nwas much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and\r\nagreeable in colour.', u'\u201cJekyll,\u201d cried Utterson, with a loud voice, \u201cI demand to see you.\u201d He\r\npaused a moment, but there came no reply.', u'At the\r\nfurther end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red\r\nbaize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the\r\ndoctor\u2019s cabinet.', u'Six o\u2019clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently\r\nnear to Mr. Utterson\u2019s dwelling, and still he was digging at the\r\nproblem.', u'\u201cThese are all very strange circumstances,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \u201cbut I\r\nthink I begin to see daylight.', u'\u201cWell, sir,\u201d returned the clerk, \u201cthere\u2019s a rather singular\r\nresemblance;

Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was
never lighted by a smile; cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;
backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow
lovable.
La minore:
Utterson sighed.

but if you cannot keep\r\nclear of this accursed topic, then in God\u2019s name, go, for I cannot bear\r\nit.\u201d\r\n\r\nAs soon as he got home, Utterson sat down and wrote to Jekyll,\r\ncomplaining of his exclusion from the house, and asking the cause of\r\nthis unhappy break with Lanyon; and the next day brought him a long\r\nanswer, often very pathetically worded, and sometimes darkly mysterious\r\nin drift.', u'To tell you the\r\ntruth, I am uneasy about poor Jekyll; and even outside, I feel as if\r\nthe presence of a friend might do him good.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe court was very cool and a little damp, and full of premature\r\ntwilight, although the sky, high up overhead, was still bright with\r\nsunset.', u'In short, from that day forth it seemed only by a\r\ngreat effort as of gymnastics, and only under the immediate stimulation\r\nof the drug, that I was able to wear the countenance of Jekyll.', u'It\r\nmay then already be too late; and if that night passes without event,\r\nyou will know that you have seen the last of Henry Jekyll.\u201d\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the reading of this letter, I made sure my colleague was insane;\r\nbut till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt, I felt bound\r\nto do as he requested.', u'Hence,\r\nalthough I had now two characters as well as two appearances, one was\r\nwholly evil, and the other was still the old Henry Jekyll, that\r\nincongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement I had already\r\nlearned to despair.', u'Now, however, and in the light of that morning\u2019s accident, I was led to\r\nremark that whereas, in the beginning, the difficulty had been to throw\r\noff the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly\r\ntransferred itself to the other side.', u'and how should I, an unknown and displeasing visitor,\r\nprevail on the famous physician to rifle the study of his colleague,\r\nDr. Jekyll?', u'It is one of those affairs that cannot be mended by talking.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJekyll,\u201d said Utterson, \u201cyou know me: I am a man to be trusted.', u'Here then, as I lay down the pen and proceed to seal up my\r\nconfession, I bring the life of that unhappy Henry Jekyll to an end.', u'I next drew up that\r\nwill to which you so much objected;

one lay\r\nbeside the tea things open, and Utterson was amazed to find it a copy\r\nof a pious work, for which Jekyll had several times expressed a great\r\nesteem, annotated, in his own hand with startling blasphemies.', u'\u201cBut it is more than ten years since Henry\r\nJekyll became too fanciful for me.', u'Jekyll had more than a father\u2019s\r\ninterest; Hyde had more than a son\u2019s indifference.', u'Here were a phial of some salt, and the record of a series of\r\nexperiments that had led (like too many of Jekyll\u2019s investigations) to\r\nno end of practical usefulness.', u'Mr. Utterson had already quailed at the name of Hyde; but when the\r\nstick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and\r\nbattered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself\r\npresented many years before to Henry Jekyll.', u'\u201cI have been wanting to speak to you, Jekyll,\u201d began the latter.', u'\u201cAre you come from Dr. Jekyll?\u201d I asked.', u'\u201cO God!\u201d I screamed, and \u201cO God!\u201d again and again;

and it is the belief of my heart that there was murder done.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cPoole,\u201d replied the lawyer, \u201cif you say that, it will become my duty\r\nto make certain.', u'The will was holograph, for\r\nMr. Utterson though he took charge of it now that it was made, had\r\nrefused to lend the least assistance in the making of it; it provided\r\nnot only that, in case of the decease of Henry Jekyll, M.D., D.C.L.,\r\nL.L.D., F.R.S., etc., all his possessions were to pass into the hands\r\nof his \u201cfriend and benefactor Edward Hyde,\u201d but that in case of Dr.\r\nJekyll\u2019s \u201cdisappearance or unexplained absence for any period exceeding\r\nthree calendar months,\u201d the said Edward Hyde should step into the said\r\nHenry Jekyll\u2019s shoes without further delay and free from any burthen or\r\nobligation beyond the payment of a few small sums to the members of the\r\ndoctor\u2019s household.', u'The bargain might appear\r\nunequal; but there was still another consideration in the scales; for\r\nwhile Jekyll would suffer smartingly in the fires of abstinence, Hyde\r\nwould be not even conscious of all that he had lost.', u'\u201cPoor Harry\r\nJekyll,\u201d he thought, \u201cmy mind misgives me he is in deep waters!', u'This, then, is the last\r\ntime, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his own thoughts\r\nor see his own face (now how sadly altered!)', u'Utterson of Gaunt Street\u2014you must have heard of my\r\nname;

a lamp was set lighted on the\r\nchimney shelf, for even in the houses the fog began to lie thickly; and\r\nthere, close up to the warmth, sat Dr. Jekyll, looking deathly sick.', u'Yes, I had gone to bed\r\nHenry Jekyll, I had awakened Edward Hyde.', u'Let me but escape into my\r\nlaboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and swallow the\r\ndraught that I had always standing ready;

LANYON\u2019S NARRATIVE\r\n\r\nOn the ninth of January, now four days ago, I received by the evening\r\ndelivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of my colleague\r\nand old school companion, Henry Jekyll.', u'The powers of Hyde seemed to have\r\ngrown with the sickliness of Jekyll.', u'To this\r\nrule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite\r\nside of the fire\u2014a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with\r\nsomething of a stylish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and\r\nkindness\u2014you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson\r\na sincere and warm affection.', u'His terror of the gallows drove him continually to\r\ncommit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a\r\npart instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he loathed the\r\ndespondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and he resented the\r\ndislike with which he was himself regarded.', u'\u201cI give you fair warning, our\r\nsuspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,\u201d he resumed; \u201cif\r\nnot by fair means, then by foul\u2014if not of your consent, then by brute\r\nforce!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUtterson,\u201d said the voice, \u201cfor God\u2019s sake, have mercy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s not Jekyll\u2019s voice\u2014it\u2019s Hyde\u2019s!\u201d cried Utterson.', u'The pangs of transformation had not\r\ndone tearing him, before Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of\r\ngratitude and remorse, had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped\r\nhands to God.', u'\u201cI wish to\r\nsee or hear no more of Dr. Jekyll,\u201d he said in a loud, unsteady voice.', u'Jekyll was no worse;\r\nhe woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even\r\nmake haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde.', u'I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of\r\nmy own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared\r\nand drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange\r\narray; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape\r\nand was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of\r\nbreakfasting.', u'A closet was filled with\r\nwine; the plate was of silver, the napery elegant; a good picture hung\r\nupon the walls, a gift (as Utterson supposed) from Henry Jekyll, who\r\nwas much of a connoisseur; and the carpets were of many plies and\r\nagreeable in colour.', u'\u201cJekyll,\u201d cried Utterson, with a loud voice, \u201cI demand to see you.\u201d He\r\npaused a moment, but there came no reply.', u'An act of\r\ncruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I\r\nrecognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and\r\nthe child\u2019s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my\r\nlife; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward\r\nHyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in\r\nthe name of Henry Jekyll.', u'\u201cI have been\r\nlearning something of young Hyde.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and\r\nthere came a blackness about his eyes.', u'I sometimes think if we knew all, we should be more\r\nglad to get away.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cJekyll is ill, too,\u201d observed Utterson.', u'\u201cI burned it,\u201d replied Jekyll, \u201cbefore I thought what I was about.', u'\u201cWell,\u201d said he, at last, \u201clet me\r\nsee the letter.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed \u201cEdward\r\nHyde\u201d: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer\u2019s benefactor,\r\nDr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand\r\ngenerosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had\r\nmeans of escape on which he placed a sure dependence.', u'\u201cI suppose, Lanyon,\u201d said he, \u201cyou and I must be the two oldest friends\r\nthat Henry Jekyll has?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI wish the friends were younger,\u201d chuckled Dr. Lanyon.', u'The powders were neatly\r\nenough made up, but not with the nicety of the dispensing chemist; so\r\nthat it was plain they were of Jekyll\u2019s private manufacture; and when I\r\nopened one of the wrappers I found what seemed to me a simple\r\ncrystalline salt of a white colour.', u'The creature who crept into my house that\r\nnight was, on Jekyll\u2019s own confession, known by the name of Hyde and\r\nhunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of Carew.', u'Henry Jekyll stood at times\r\naghast before the acts of Edward Hyde; but the situation was apart from\r\nordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience.', u'\u201cI do not blame our\r\nold friend,\u201d Jekyll wrote, \u201cbut I share his view that we must never\r\nmeet.'])

cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;\r\nbackward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow\r\nlovable.', u'They drew near on tiptoe, turned it on its back and\r\nbeheld the face of Edward Hyde.', u'\u201cAnd now one word more:\r\nit was Hyde who dictated the terms in your will about that\r\ndisappearance?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe doctor seemed seized with a qualm of faintness; he shut his mouth\r\ntight and nodded.', u'I have really a very great interest in poor Hyde.', u'But time began at last to\r\nobliterate the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began\r\nto grow into a thing of course; I began to be tortured with throes and\r\nlongings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last, in an hour\r\nof moral weakness, I once again compounded and swallowed the\r\ntransforming draught.', u'This, as\r\nI take it, was because all human beings, as we meet them, are\r\ncommingled out of good and evil: and Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of\r\nmankind, was pure evil.', u'\u201cI have been\r\nlearning something of young Hyde.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe large handsome face of Dr. Jekyll grew pale to the very lips, and\r\nthere came a blackness about his eyes.', u'At all\r\nhours of the day and night, I would be taken with the premonitory\r\nshudder; above all, if I slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair,\r\nit was always as Hyde that I awakened.', u'I could\r\nnot think that this earth contained a place for sufferings and terrors\r\nso unmanning; and you can do but one thing, Utterson, to lighten this\r\ndestiny, and that is to respect my silence.\u201d Utterson was amazed; the\r\ndark influence of Hyde had been withdrawn, the doctor had returned to\r\nhis old tasks and amities; a week ago, the prospect had smiled with\r\nevery promise of a cheerful and an honoured age; and now in a moment,\r\nfriendship, and peace of mind, and the whole tenor of his life were\r\nwrecked.', u'Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an\r\nimpression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a\r\ndispleasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of\r\nmurderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,\r\nwhispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against\r\nhim, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown\r\ndisgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him.', u'That part of me which I had the power of\r\nprojecting, had lately been much exercised and nourished; it had seemed\r\nto me of late as though the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature,\r\nas though (when I wore that form) I were conscious of a more generous\r\ntide of blood; and I began to spy a danger that, if this were much\r\nprolonged, the balance of my nature might be permanently overthrown,\r\nthe power of voluntary change be forfeited, and the character of Edward\r\nHyde become irrevocably mine.', u'Yes, I preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded by\r\nfriends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute farewell to\r\nthe liberty, the comparative youth, the light step, leaping impulses\r\nand secret pleasures, that I had enjoyed in the disguise of Hyde.', u'And hence, as I think, it came about that Edward Hyde\r\nwas so much smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll.', u'Not that I dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare\r\nidea of that would startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person\r\nthat I was once more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was\r\nas an ordinary secret sinner that I at last fell before the assaults of\r\ntemptation.', u'Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether I would or not, I was\r\nnow confined to the better part of my existence; and O, how I rejoiced\r\nto think of it!', u'At that time my virtue slumbered; my\r\nevil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift to seize the\r\noccasion; and the thing that was projected was Edward Hyde.', u'The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of\r\ndisquietude.', u'I took and furnished that\r\nhouse in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the police; and engaged as\r\na housekeeper a creature whom I knew well to be silent and\r\nunscrupulous.', u'\u201cThis Master Hyde, if he were studied,\u201d thought he, \u201cmust have\r\nsecrets of his own; black secrets, by the look of him; secrets compared\r\nto which poor Jekyll\u2019s worst would be like sunshine.', u'The first was a will, drawn in\r\nthe same eccentric terms as the one which he had returned six months\r\nbefore, to serve as a testament in case of death and as a deed of gift\r\nin case of disappearance; but in place of the name of Edward Hyde, the\r\nlawyer, with indescribable amazement read the name of Gabriel John\r\nUtterson.', u'It was a\r\nman of the name of Hyde.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHm,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'It was the hand of\r\nEdward Hyde.', u'But this danger was easily eliminated from\r\nthe future, by opening an account at another bank in the name of Edward\r\nHyde himself; and when, by sloping my own hand backward, I had supplied\r\nmy double with a signature, I thought I sat beyond the reach of fate.', u'And\r\nhitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his\r\nindignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge.', u'I have\r\nobserved that when I wore the semblance of Edward Hyde, none could come\r\nnear to me at first without a visible misgiving of the flesh.', u'The next day, came the news that the murder had not been overlooked,\r\nthat the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and that the victim was\r\na man high in public estimation.', u'Jekyll was now my city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an\r\ninstant, and the hands of all men would be raised to take and slay him.', u'Hyde in danger of\r\nhis life was a creature new to me; shaken with inordinate anger, strung\r\nto the pitch of murder, lusting to inflict pain.', u'I\r\nmade this choice perhaps with some unconscious reservation, for I\r\nneither gave up the house in Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward\r\nHyde, which still lay ready in my cabinet.', u'I have more than\r\nonce observed that in my second character, my faculties seemed\r\nsharpened to a point and my spirits more tensely elastic; thus it came\r\nabout that, where Jekyll perhaps might have succumbed, Hyde rose to the\r\nimportance of the moment.', u'The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll was of\r\na different order.', u'I was once more Edward Hyde.', u'I do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself upon his\r\nvice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by the dangers that\r\nhe runs through his brutish, physical insensibility; neither had I,\r\nlong as I had considered my position, made enough allowance for the\r\ncomplete moral insensibility and insensate readiness to evil, which\r\nwere the leading characters of Edward Hyde.', u'He had now seen the full deformity of that creature\r\nthat shared with him some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was\r\nco-heir with him to death: and beyond these links of community, which\r\nin themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he thought\r\nof Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not only hellish\r\nbut inorganic.', u'\u201cI give you fair warning, our\r\nsuspicions are aroused, and I must and shall see you,\u201d he resumed; \u201cif\r\nnot by fair means, then by foul\u2014if not of your consent, then by brute\r\nforce!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cUtterson,\u201d said the voice, \u201cfor God\u2019s sake, have mercy!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s not Jekyll\u2019s voice\u2014it\u2019s Hyde\u2019s!\u201d cried Utterson.', u'Presently her eye wandered\r\nto the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr.\r\nHyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a\r\ndislike.', u'It was\r\nHyde, after all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty.', u'\u201cIt may be useful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d returned Mr. Hyde, \u201cIt is as well we have met; and _\xe0 propos_,\r\nyou should have my address.\u201d And he gave a number of a street in Soho.', u'The old gentleman\r\ntook a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle\r\nhurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to\r\nthe earth.', u'And the danger of it; for if this Hyde suspects the existence of the\r\nwill, he may grow impatient to inherit.', u'Jekyll was no worse;\r\nhe woke again to his good qualities seemingly unimpaired; he would even\r\nmake haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil done by Hyde.', u'I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of\r\nmy own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared\r\nand drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange\r\narray; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape\r\nand was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of\r\nbreakfasting.', u'O, I know it\u2019s not evidence, Mr. Utterson;\r\nI\u2019m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I\r\ngive you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, ay,\u201d said the lawyer.', u'The powers of Hyde seemed to have\r\ngrown with the sickliness of Jekyll.', u'But tonight there was a shudder\r\nin his blood; the face of Hyde sat heavy on his memory; he felt (what\r\nwas rare with him) a nausea and distaste of life; and in the gloom of\r\nhis spirits, he seemed to read a menace in the flickering of the\r\nfirelight on the polished cabinets and the uneasy starting of the\r\nshadow on the roof.', u'An act of\r\ncruelty to a child aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom I\r\nrecognised the other day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and\r\nthe child\u2019s family joined him; there were moments when I feared for my\r\nlife; and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, Edward\r\nHyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque drawn in\r\nthe name of Henry Jekyll.', u'The death of Sir Danvers was, to his\r\nway of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde.', u'Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the draught, and as he\r\ndrank it, pledged the dead man.', u'\u201cWell,\u201d said he, at last, \u201clet me\r\nsee the letter.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe letter was written in an odd, upright hand and signed \u201cEdward\r\nHyde\u201d: and it signified, briefly enough, that the writer\u2019s benefactor,\r\nDr. Jekyll, whom he had long so unworthily repaid for a thousand\r\ngenerosities, need labour under no alarm for his safety, as he had\r\nmeans of escape on which he placed a sure dependence.', u'I\r\nbelieve you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before\r\nmyself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn\u2019t what you fancy;\r\nit is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I\r\nwill tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.', u'\u201cIs this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?\u201d he inquired.', u'\u201cHyde?\u201d repeated Lanyon.', u'Will Hyde die upon the scaffold?', u'The creature who crept into my house that\r\nnight was, on Jekyll\u2019s own confession, known by the name of Hyde and\r\nhunted for in every corner of the land as the murderer of Carew.', u'But in\r\nthe will, that idea had sprung from the sinister suggestion of the man\r\nHyde; it was set there with a purpose all too plain and horrible.', u'It was no longer the fear of the gallows, it\r\nwas the horror of being Hyde that racked me.', u'On the other side, I announced to my servants that a Mr.\r\nHyde (whom I described) was to have full liberty and power about my\r\nhouse in the square; and to parry mishaps, I even called and made\r\nmyself a familiar object, in my second character.', u'Hyde has a\r\nkey.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYour master seems to repose a great deal of trust in that young man,\r\nPoole,\u201d resumed the other musingly.', u'I\r\ncrossed the yard, wherein the constellations looked down upon me, I\r\ncould have thought, with wonder, the first creature of that sort that\r\ntheir unsleeping vigilance had yet disclosed to them; I stole through\r\nthe corridors, a stranger in my own house; and coming to my room, I saw\r\nfor the first time the appearance of Edward Hyde.', u'Yes,\r\nshe said, this was Mr. Hyde\u2019s, but he was not at home; he had been in\r\nthat night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour;\r\nthere was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and\r\nhe was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she\r\nhad seen him till yesterday.'])

Mr. Utterson the lawyer was a man of a rugged countenance that was

backward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow
lovable.

cold, scanty and embarrassed in discourse;\r\nbackward in sentiment; lean, long, dusty, dreary and yet somehow\r\nlovable.', u'\u201cSir,\u201d he said, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, \u201cWas that my master\u2019s\r\nvoice?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIt seems much changed,\u201d replied the lawyer, very pale, but giving look\r\nfor look.', u'\u201cIs\r\nthat right, when Dr. Jekyll is from home?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cQuite right, Mr. Utterson, sir,\u201d replied the servant.', u'The\r\nclerk, besides, was a man of counsel; he could scarce read so strange a\r\ndocument without dropping a remark; and by that remark Mr. Utterson\r\nmight shape his future course.', u'From that time forward, Mr. Utterson began to haunt the door in the\r\nby-street of shops.', u'\u201cI did not\r\nthink you would have lied.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cCome,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \u201cthat is not fitting language.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe other snarled aloud into a savage laugh; and the next moment, with\r\nextraordinary quickness, he had unlocked the door and disappeared into\r\nthe house.', u'On the desk, among the neat\r\narray of papers, a large envelope was uppermost, and bore, in the\r\ndoctor\u2019s hand, the name of Mr. Utterson.', u'Mr. Hyde was pale and dwarfish, he gave an\r\nimpression of deformity without any nameable malformation, he had a\r\ndispleasing smile, he had borne himself to the lawyer with a sort of\r\nmurderous mixture of timidity and boldness, and he spoke with a husky,\r\nwhispering and somewhat broken voice; all these were points against\r\nhim, but not all of these together could explain the hitherto unknown\r\ndisgust, loathing and fear with which Mr. Utterson regarded him.', u'\u201cI will see, Mr. Utterson,\u201d said Poole, admitting the visitor, as he\r\nspoke, into a large, low-roofed, comfortable hall paved with flags,\r\nwarmed (after the fashion of a country house) by a bright, open fire,\r\nand furnished with costly cabinets of oak.', u'From the time he had left the house in Soho on the morning of\r\nthe murder, he was simply blotted out; and gradually, as time drew on,\r\nMr. Utterson began to recover from the hotness of his alarm, and to\r\ngrow more at quiet with himself.', u'And still the figure had no face by which he might know\r\nit; even in his dreams, it had no face, or one that baffled him and\r\nmelted before his eyes; and thus it was that there sprang up and grew\r\napace in the lawyer\u2019s mind a singularly strong, almost an inordinate,\r\ncuriosity to behold the features of the real Mr. Hyde.', u'Mr. Enfield and the lawyer were on the other side of the by-street; but\r\nwhen they came abreast of the entry, the former lifted up his cane and\r\npointed.', u'\u201cI am an old friend of\r\nDr. Jekyll\u2019s\u2014Mr.', u'The lawyer stood awhile when Mr. Hyde had left him, the picture of\r\ndisquietude.', u'We shall never\r\nsee more of Mr. Hyde.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cI hope not,\u201d said Utterson.', u'It was a\r\nman of the name of Hyde.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cHm,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'No doubt the feat was easy to Mr. Utterson; for he was undemonstrative\r\nat the best, and even his friendship seemed to be founded in a similar\r\ncatholicity of good-nature.', u'\u201cThank you, sir,\u201d said Poole, with a note of something like triumph in\r\nhis voice; and taking up his candle, he led Mr. Utterson back across\r\nthe yard and into the great kitchen, where the fire was out and the\r\nbeetles were leaping on the floor.', u'It seemed to have swept the streets\r\nunusually bare of passengers, besides; for Mr. Utterson thought he had\r\nnever seen that part of London so deserted.', u'A great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but the\r\nwind was continually charging and routing these embattled vapours; so\r\nthat as the cab crawled from street to street, Mr. Utterson beheld a\r\nmarvelous number of degrees and hues of twilight; for here it would be\r\ndark like the back-end of evening; and there would be a glow of a rich,\r\nlurid brown, like the light of some strange conflagration; and here,\r\nfor a moment, the fog would be quite broken up, and a haggard shaft of\r\ndaylight would glance in between the swirling wreaths.', u'And\r\nhitherto it was his ignorance of Mr. Hyde that had swelled his\r\nindignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was his knowledge.', u'Mr. Utterson stepped out and touched him on the shoulder as he passed.', u'A purse and gold\r\nwatch were found upon the victim: but no cards or papers, except a\r\nsealed and stamped envelope, which he had been probably carrying to the\r\npost, and which bore the name and address of Mr. Utterson.', u'\u201cNow I shall know you\r\nagain,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'And see here, sir, if by any\r\nchance he was to ask you in, don\u2019t go.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson\u2019s nerves, at this unlooked-for termination, gave a jerk\r\nthat nearly threw him from his balance; but he recollected his courage\r\nand followed the butler into the laboratory building through the\r\nsurgical theatre, with its lumber of crates and bottles, to the foot of\r\nthe stair.', u'From this he was recalled by Mr. Utterson asking rather suddenly: \u201cAnd\r\nyou don\u2019t know if the drawer of the cheque lives there?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cA likely place, isn\u2019t it?\u201d returned Mr. Enfield.', u'At the sight of\r\nMr. Utterson, the housemaid broke into hysterical whimpering; and the\r\ncook, crying out \u201cBless God!', u'And yet it\u2019s not so sure; for the buildings are so packed\r\ntogether about the court, that it\u2019s hard to say where one ends and\r\nanother begins.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe pair walked on again for a while in silence; and then \u201cEnfield,\u201d\r\nsaid Mr. Utterson, \u201cthat\u2019s a good rule of yours.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes, I think it is,\u201d returned Enfield.', u'The cheque was genuine.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cTut-tut!\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'At sight of Mr. Utterson, he sprang up\r\nfrom his chair and welcomed him with both hands.', u'But hark again, a little closer\u2014put your heart in your ears, Mr.\r\nUtterson, and tell me, is that the doctor\u2019s foot?\u201d\r\n\r\nThe steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all they\r\nwent so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy creaking tread\r\nof Henry Jekyll.', u'One house, however, second from the corner, was still\r\noccupied entire; and at the door of this, which wore a great air of\r\nwealth and comfort, though it was now plunged in darkness except for\r\nthe fanlight, Mr. Utterson stopped and knocked.', u'Presently after, he sat on one side of his own hearth, with Mr.', u'\u201cBut I happen to have\r\nnoticed his address; he lives in some square or other.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAnd you never asked about the\u2014place with the door?\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'To this\r\nrule, Dr. Jekyll was no exception; and as he now sat on the opposite\r\nside of the fire\u2014a large, well-made, smooth-faced man of fifty, with\r\nsomething of a stylish cast perhaps, but every mark of capacity and\r\nkindness\u2014you could see by his looks that he cherished for Mr. Utterson\r\na sincere and warm affection.', u'That won\u2019t hold water; it doesn\u2019t commend\r\nitself to reason.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, Mr. Utterson, you are a hard man to satisfy, but I\u2019ll do it\r\nyet,\u201d said Poole.', u'Presently her eye wandered\r\nto the other, and she was surprised to recognise in him a certain Mr.\r\nHyde, who had once visited her master and for whom she had conceived a\r\ndislike.', u'But indeed, Utterson, I\r\nam very glad to see you; this is really a great pleasure; I would ask\r\nyou and Mr. Enfield up, but the place is really not fit.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWhy, then,\u201d said the lawyer, good-naturedly, \u201cthe best thing we can do\r\nis to stay down here and speak with you from where we are.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThat is just what I was about to venture to propose,\u201d returned the\r\ndoctor with a smile.', u'Mr. Utterson, sir, I\u2019m afraid.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cNow, my good man,\u201d said the lawyer, \u201cbe explicit.', u'\u201cIt may be useful.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cYes,\u201d returned Mr. Hyde, \u201cIt is as well we have met; and _\xe0 propos_,\r\nyou should have my address.\u201d And he gave a number of a street in Soho.', u'The old gentleman\r\ntook a step back, with the air of one very much surprised and a trifle\r\nhurt; and at that Mr. Hyde broke out of all bounds and clubbed him to\r\nthe earth.', u'I saw him use it\r\nnot a week ago.\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson sighed deeply but said never a word; and the young man\r\npresently resumed.', u'\u201cI understand.\u201d\r\n\r\nBut no sooner was Mr. Utterson alone that night, than he locked the\r\nnote into his safe, where it reposed from that time forward.', u'Mr. Utterson\r\nhad been some minutes at his post, when he was aware of an odd light\r\nfootstep drawing near.', u'Anything private, Mr. Utterson?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cOnly an invitation to dinner.', u'\u201cBut I have studied the place for myself,\u201d continued Mr. Enfield.', u'I had soon dressed, as well as I was able, in clothes of\r\nmy own size: had soon passed through the house, where Bradshaw stared\r\nand drew back at seeing Mr. Hyde at such an hour and in such a strange\r\narray; and ten minutes later, Dr. Jekyll had returned to his own shape\r\nand was sitting down, with a darkened brow, to make a feint of\r\nbreakfasting.', u'\u201cI see you feel as I do,\u201d said Mr. Enfield.', u'O, I know it\u2019s not evidence, Mr. Utterson;\r\nI\u2019m book-learned enough for that; but a man has his feelings, and I\r\ngive you my bible-word it was Mr. Hyde!\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cAy, ay,\u201d said the lawyer.', u'At the\r\nfurther end, a flight of stairs mounted to a door covered with red\r\nbaize; and through this, Mr. Utterson was at last received into the\r\ndoctor\u2019s cabinet.', u'Six o\u2019clock struck on the bells of the church that was so conveniently\r\nnear to Mr. Utterson\u2019s dwelling, and still he was digging at the\r\nproblem.', u'\u201cThese are all very strange circumstances,\u201d said Mr. Utterson, \u201cbut I\r\nthink I begin to see daylight.', u'The death of Sir Danvers was, to his\r\nway of thinking, more than paid for by the disappearance of Mr. Hyde.', u'I\r\nbelieve you fully; I would trust you before any man alive, ay, before\r\nmyself, if I could make the choice; but indeed it isn\u2019t what you fancy;\r\nit is not as bad as that; and just to put your good heart at rest, I\r\nwill tell you one thing: the moment I choose, I can be rid of Mr. Hyde.', u'\u201cIs this Mr. Hyde a person of small stature?\u201d he inquired.', u'\u201cFor God\u2019s sake,\u201d he added, \u201cfind me some of the old.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThis is a strange note,\u201d said Mr. Utterson; and then sharply, \u201cHow do\r\nyou come to have it open?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cThe man at Maw\u2019s was main angry, sir, and he threw it back to me like\r\nso much dirt,\u201d returned Poole.', u'\u201cWhose description?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWe have common friends,\u201d said Mr. Utterson.', u'\u201cAnd\r\nnow,\u201d continued the butler, addressing the knife-boy, \u201creach me a\r\ncandle, and we\u2019ll get this through hands at once.\u201d And then he begged\r\nMr. Utterson to follow him, and led the way to the back garden.', u'INCIDENT OF THE LETTER\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon, when Mr. Utterson found his way to Dr.\r\nJekyll\u2019s door, where he was at once admitted by Poole, and carried down\r\nby the kitchen offices and across a yard which had once been a garden,\r\nto the building which was indifferently known as the laboratory or\r\ndissecting rooms.', u'What has he done?\u201d\r\n\r\nMr. Utterson and the inspector exchanged glances.', u'Hence, no doubt\r\nthe bond that united him to Mr. Richard Enfield, his distant kinsman,\r\nthe well-known man about town.', u'But Mr. Enfield only nodded his head very seriously, and walked on once\r\nmore in silence.', u'\u201cDid you ever remark that door?\u201d he asked; and when his companion had\r\nreplied in the affirmative, \u201cIt is connected in my mind,\u201d added he,\r\n\u201cwith a very odd story.\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cIndeed?\u201d said Mr. Utterson, with a slight change of voice, \u201cand what\r\nwas that?\u201d\r\n\r\n\u201cWell, it was this way,\u201d returned Mr. Enfield: \u201cI was coming home from\r\nsome place at the end of the world, about three o\u2019clock of a black\r\nwinter morning, and my way lay through a part of town where there was\r\nliterally nothing to be seen but lamps.', u'Yes,\r\nshe said, this was Mr. Hyde\u2019s, but he was not at home; he had been in\r\nthat night very late, but he had gone away again in less than an hour;\r\nthere was nothing strange in that; his habits were very irregular, and\r\nhe was often absent; for instance, it was nearly two months since she\r\nhad seen him till yesterday.'])
